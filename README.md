# JS-Back-End---2023
For the course
The course is intensive and aims to introduce learners to the development of server-side JavaScript applications on the Node.js platform using Express.js as a framework. During the course, students will understand how to create a server with Node.js, learn the server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB using modern techniques and tools. One of the most popular non-relational databases, MongoDB, will be covered, along with the Mongoose library for retrieving data from it. Towards the end of the course, a complete REST API will be built from scratch using Express.js and MongoDB. There is a strong emphasis on hands-on exercises that will involve learners in real-world web development projects, implementing site fragments and creating complete modern websites with a good look, modern structure and mobile support.
